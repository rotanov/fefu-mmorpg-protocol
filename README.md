### Requirements

The key words `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `REQUIRED`, `SHALL`, `SHALL NOT`, `SHOULD`,
`SHOULD NOT`, `RECOMMENDED`, `MAY`, and `OPTIONAL` in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more of the
MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the protocols it implements. An
implementation that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD
level requirements for its protocols is said to be `unconditionally compliant`;
one that satisfies all the MUST level requirements but not all the SHOULD level
requirements for its protocols is said to be `conditionally compliant.`

### Introduction

Client and server communicate with request and response messages.
Each message MUST be represented by a single JSON object.
Messages are sent via either HTTP/1.1 or WebSocket protocol.

Request message MUST contain a single key `action` with a corresponding string
value determining required action.
Each request message MUST be answered with a corresponging response message.

Response message MUST contain a single key `result` with a corresponding value
describing result.

Both request and response messages MAY contain any other key/value pairs
specific for particular request/response.

### Terminology

TBD — http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TBD

Key in context of json message stands for name in name/value pair which is the
same as key/value pair or attribute/value pair. JSON RFC uses `name` in such
context.

### Authorization

An authorization stage of communication MUST use HTTP/1.1 as an underlying
transport. A method of HTTP request MUST be POST. Message MUST be HTTP
message-body. Content-Type header of HTTP response MUST be `application/json`.

#### Register

The requirements for user credentials are as follows:

login: `[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,36}` i.e. minimal length is 2 symbols and maximum
length is 36 symbols. Allowed charset is latin symbols and numbers.

password: `.{6, 36}` i.e. minimal length is 6 symbols and maximum length is
36 symbols. Any character is allowed except characters indexed from 0 to 31
in ASCII.

##### Request

    action: register
    login: <new client's login> 
    password: <new client's password>

##### Response

    result: [ok, badPassword, badLogin, loginExists]

#### Login

##### Request
 
    action: login
    login: <client's login> 
    password: <client's password>

##### Response

    result: [ok, invalidCredentials]
    sid: <string representation of session identifier>
    webSocket: <WebSocket server URI>
    id: <player ID for use with Game Interaction requests>

### Game Interaction

All communication other than authorization stage is done via WebSocket protocol
as underlying transport.

#### Common Invariants

Those rules apply to any client-server communication below this point.
Explicit inclusion of these rules may be ommited. If there is an exception from
the rules, the corresponding section shall state it explicitly.

Each request message sent after client has been logged in MUST have a key `sid`
with a string value of client sid provided by server. In case of invalid sid the
`result` key of response MUST have a value of `badSid`.

In case of successful response `result` key of respone MUST have a value `ok`.

On all requests with the key `action` client MUST receive the same key 'action' with the same value.

#### Logout

##### Request

    action: logout
    sid: <client's sid>

##### Response

    result: [ok, badSid]

#### Examine

##### Request

    action: examine
    id: <actor's identifier>

##### Response

    result: [ok, badSid, badId]
    id: <actor's id>
    type: <actor's type>
    login: <player's login>
    x: <x coordinate>
    y: <y coordinate>

#### Get Dictionary

Dictionary is a json object describing mapping from game map cell (recieved via
look action) to string value of cell type e.g.

```json
{
    ".": "grass",
    "#": "wall"
}
```

##### Request

    action: getDictionary

##### Response

    dictionary: {...}

#### Look

A request for server to provide information for a map area around the client's
player. Such information MUST be provided via keys `map` and `objects`.

TBD: If size of such an area must be standardized

`map` key MUST have a value of an array of array of strings. Such strings are
decoded via dictionary got using `getDictionary` request. `map` 2d array has
row-major order. E.g. for a 4x6 (4 rows, 6 columns) map area:

```json
"map":
[
    ["#", "#", ".", "#", "#", "#"],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    ["#", "#", "#", ".", "#", "#"]
]
```

`actors` key MUST have a value of an array of objects type. Each element of the
array MUST describe a single actor present at the provided area in the following
form:

    type: <actor's type>
    id: <actor's id>
    x: <x coordinate of actor>
    y: <y coordinate of actor>

##### Request

    action: look

##### Response

    map: [[...]]
    actors: [{...}, ...]

#### Move
    
##### Request

    action: move
    direction: [west, north, east, south]
    tick: <tick number for move action>

##### Response

TBD:

- If client should expect `"result": "ok"` or even any response at all
- If `result` must be distinct from `ok` in case of player trying to move in the
direction of wall right before him

#### Tick

For each simulation tick server MUST broadcast current tick to all the clients.
Tick message is neither request nor response message therefore implicit rules
for keys `sid`, `action`, `result` don't apply to it.

Tick message is a JSON object with a single key `tick` with a value of
broadcasted tick number.

Tick numbers are required to grow monotonously by `1` for each tick.
